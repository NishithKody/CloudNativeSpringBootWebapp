cmd vs entrypoint
entrypoint is used to get a argument from the user

in cmd, the command line parameters replace it completely
in entrypoint the command line parameters append it

we can use entrypoint and cmd for a image which takes in a argument and has a default value

entrypoint ["sleep"]
cmd ["5"]
